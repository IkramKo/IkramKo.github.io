# PortfolioAngular
Personal portfolio made in Angular.

## To Do
This portfolio was initially made in 2022, when I was beginning to show interest in web development. Since then, I have completed many internships and projects, which have all taught me invaluable knowledge. The following `To Do` list will help me structure and prioritize the improvements I wish to bring to this portfolio.  
  
:black_square_button: Add projects done during M.Ing and after  
:black_square_button: Separate skills/projects according to whether they pertain to cybersecurity or software development  
:black_square_button: Update the UI (new, fresh color palette and mode modern component design), as it was designed when I had much less experience in web development  
:black_square_button: Improve the responsiveness, as it doesn't do well with much smaller screens  
:black_square_button: Re-deploy the portfolion on AWS S3 using [this ongoing project](https://github.com/IkramKo/cloud_resume)
