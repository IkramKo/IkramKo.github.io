                    Hi, my name is Ikram and I'm an aspiring software engineer! 
                    <br><br>
                    Growing up, I've picked up various creative hobbies, such as painting, writing and sowing. Creating things I could be proud of has always been a process I enjoyed. 
                    I've been introduced to tech at a young age, back when I was given my own computer and no longer had to fight with my brother for the right to use use his. I was able to play video games to my heart's content. The gaming then lead to a genuine interest in the tech field.
                    When the time came, software development was the obvious career choice for me, since it combined creativity and technical skills!
                    <br><br>
                    I'm currently looking for opportunities to put the skills I have acquired in my studies to use in order to perfect them, and even acquire new ones.
